# Restaurant Website
Responsive website I developed for a class project.

The assignment was to take an existing restaurant that had an unsatisfactory website, and develop a better version of that site.
This project demonstrates my ability to create websites using HTML and CSS.
I used media queries to make the website responsive.
That is, it adapts to different screen sizes, so it looks clean on every device, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
